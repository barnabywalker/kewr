An R package to access data from RGB Kew's APIs.

## Overview

kewr is meant to make accessing data from one of RGB Kew easier and to provide a consistent interface their public APIs.

This package should cover:

- [x] [World Checklist of Vascular Plants](https://wcvp.science.kew.org/)
- [x] [Plants of the World Online](http://powo.science.kew.org/)
- [x] [International Plant Names Index](https://www.ipni.org/)
- [x] [Kew Names Matching Service](http://namematch.science.kew.org/)

New sources will be added as they come up.

## Installation

kewr is not on CRAN yet but you can install the latest development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("barnabywalker/kewr")
```

## Usage

Functions in this package all start with a prefix specifying what action you want to perform and a suffix referring to the resource.

Three of the resources (POWO, WCVP, and IPNI) are databases storing flora, taxonomic, or nomenclatural information. These three resources all have a `search_*` and `lookup_*`.

### Retrieving records

The `lookup_` functions can be used to retrieve a particular record by its unique IPNI ID:

``` r
lookup_powo("320035-2")
lookup_wcvp("320035-2")
lookup_ipni("320035-2")
```

IPNI contains records for authors and publications, which can also be retrieved using the `lookup_ipni` function:

``` r
lookup_ipni("20885-1", type="author")
lookup_ipni("987-2", type="publication")
```

### Searching databases

All three of these databases can be searched as well:

``` r
search_powo("Poa annua")
search_wcvp("Poa annua")
search_ipni("Poa annua")
```
And all use filters and keywords for more advanced searches:

``` r
search_powo(list(genus="Poa", distribution="Madagascar"), 
            filters=c("accepted", "species"))
search_wcvp(list(genus="Poa"), filters=c("accepted", "species"))
search_ipni(list(genus="Poa", published=1920),
            filters=c("species"))
```

The number of search results returned are determined by the `limit` keyword:

```r
search_powo(list(genus="Poa"), limit=20)
search_wcvp(list(genus="Poa"), limit=20)
search_ipni(list(genus="Poa"), limit=20)
```

The next page for a set of search results can be requested using the `request_next` function:

```r
results <- search_powo(list(genus="Poa"))
request_next(results)
```

### Downloading the WCVP

The whole of WCVP can be download to a directory using:

``` r
download_wcvp()
```

### Matching names

The KNMS resource is only used for matching names to records in POWO/WCVP:

```r
match_knms(c("Poa annua", "Magnolia grandifolia", "Bulbophyllum sp."))
```

### Tidying results

Each function in this package returns an object that stores the original response as well as the content of the response parsed into a list. This is to give the user as much flexibility as possible and to make debugging things a bit easier.

But this can be hard to use, so all the results objects can be tidied as a `tibble`:

``` r
results <- search_powo("Poa annua")
tidy(results)
```
