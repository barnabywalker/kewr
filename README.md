# kewr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

An R package to access data from RGB Kew’s APIs.

This package should cover:

  - [World Checklist of Vascular Plants](https://wcvp.science.kew.org/)
  - [Plants of the World Online](http://powo.science.kew.org/)
  - [International Plant Names Index](https://www.ipni.org/)
  - [Kew Names Matching Service](http://namematch.science.kew.org/)

I’ll add support for others as I’m made aware of them/work them out.

## Installation

You can install the released version of kewr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
